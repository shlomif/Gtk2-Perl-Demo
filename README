INSTALL
===========

No need to install the application. Just unzip it and run gtk-perl-demo.pl




TODO
============
- free text search in all the files
- cleanup README file



- add more entries to the tutorial
- organize Examples and Cookbook
- search and highlight in the current window


Disable both execute button and save button for non-executable entries
When saving a file with the name of an already existing file ask if to rewrite ?


Better grouping of the examples in the multi level tree

Syntax highlighting  (using Gtk2::SourceView ?)

Better distribution method (preprocessing an everything in one file ?)

Longer tutorial

Mark clearly on the item list which one is text and which one is code

We might want to run the external application on a fork so the user can run several 
versions at the same time and see the differences.

Have a list of all the signals and jump to files based on signal names ?
Have an index of all the words in the comments and pod sections of the files ?

See also and somehow integrate with

TODO: (from muppet)

The color snooper doesn't work --- it complains on the console that it needs an argument.

gtk-demo allows you to run scripts by activating their rows in the treeview (double-clicking or pressing enter).  It also
allows you to run more than one demo at a time.  Both of those features would be handy.  (Since you can edit the script,
it would be rather easy for a user to hose the demo.)

Mnemonics and stock icons would spruce up the main window a bit.

If you set the shadow type on the two scrolled windows to "in", the window will look a little better.

The scrolled windows should both be set to automatic on both directions; set a default size for the toplevel window to
account for that; and use an HPaned instead of an HBox to contain the tree and text -- that gives the user more control
over the size and position.

It wasn't immediately obvious that i could edit the text to modify and run the samples.  Some explanatory text and a
"revert" button would be helpful.  The feature is a really awesome idea, though.

Instead of the "List Widgets" button that turns into a "List Examples" button, you could place both trees into a
notebook.

If you add support for Gtk2::SourceView for syntax highlighting, please be sure to make it optional.  (Not very hard to
do.)




DONE
=====================================

All the examples from the distrubtion are included

Multi level tree (so the various sections can be in expandable subtree)

Add execute button

Provide an index tables where we list all the Widgets we used in the examples
and where were they used. We might be able to list all the signal handlers
and where were they used.

Code for execution should be taken from the window and we should encourage people to
experiment with the various options. 

Add save button to save the content of the code window (now that we do not have them in separate files)
