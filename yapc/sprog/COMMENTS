- I am not sure I understand the way the Connector filters (Any/None/Pipe/List/Record) work.
  Selecting "Connector In"="Any", "Connector Out"="Any" shows all the connectors
  Selecting "Connector In"="None", "Connector Out"="Any" shows only the input connectors.


- Is it possible to show all the gears that can connect after a specific gear that is
  my last gear in the workspace? (Or those that can connect before my first gear?)

- How can I create a gear of my own ?
