For ActiveState users

* I assume you already have ActiveState Perl installed on your system.
If not, download and install ActiveState Perl from
http://activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/

* Next you need to install the GTK+ 2.x.x runtime environment. The
latest version can be downloaded from
http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html

* Ensure that the <INSTALL_PATH>\GTK\2.0\bin directory is in your
PATH after this installation.

* Next you need to install the Win32 binary packages for gtk2-perl.
Download and install the latest version of Gtk2.ppd and Glib.ppd from
http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/
(Another way to install these ppds is as follows
C:\Temp> ppm install http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/Gtk2.ppd
C:\Temp> ppm install http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/Glib.ppd
)

Your system should be ready to roll !
