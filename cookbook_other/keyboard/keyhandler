the signal you want for a key-press event is, oddly
enough, "key-press-event".  (you can use either - or _, the bindings treat
them as equivalent.)

once you're inside the key-press-event handler, you peek inside the event to
see whether the key was the one you wanted.

$entry->signal_connect (key_press_event => \&key_handler);

sub key_handler {
my ($widget, $event) = @_;

# match the keyval --- in general you don't want to use magic
# numbers here, use values from %Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms instead.
if ($event->keyval == 105) {
# insert special handling here
return TRUE;  # tell the system we handled this
}

return FALSE;  # tell the system we did not handle this
}
