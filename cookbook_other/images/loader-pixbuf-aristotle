OT: I like to partition things like into smaller scopes:

    my $pixbuf = do {
        my $loader = Gtk2::Gdk::PixbufLoader->new();
        $loader->write( $image_data );
        $loader->close();
        $loader->get_pixbuf();
    };

So the next guy who looks at it doesn't have to wonder if $loader
is used anywhere later, and can see that the entire point of this
mumbo jumbo is to load something into $pixbuf.
