label is transparent, thus you have to create an eventbox under it, and pait that one.

my $box = new Gtk2::EventBox;
my $label = new Gtk2::Label('Label');
my $red = new Gtk2::Gdk::Color(65535,0,0);
$box->modify_bg('normal',$red);
$box->add($label);

That's unfortunate.  It's trivial in gtk2.  You should port at the
earliest opportunity.

Your problem is likely that the Gtk::Label is just inheriting its
parent's style, and thus doesn't have one of its own for you to dork
with.  I can't seem to find a copy of this code that hasn't been ported
to gtk2-perl, but it goes something like this:

# dupe parent widget's style -- a label isn't guaranteed to have one
of its own
my $newstyle = $window->get_style-copy;
# set up the new style the way you want.
$font = Gtk::Gdk::Font->load
("-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*");
$newstyle->font ($font);
$newstyle->fg (0, $newcolor);  # labels draw text in fg color
# explicitly tell the label to use this new style
$label->set_style ($newstyle);
