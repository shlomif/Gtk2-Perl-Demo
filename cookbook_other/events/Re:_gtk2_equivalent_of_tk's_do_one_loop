Gtk2->main_iteration does one pass through the main loop. it's pretty common
to see the following:
    Gtk2->main_iteration while (Gtk2->events_pending);
in apps. if you're wanting to run a main loop and get time for you to do your
own stuff then take a look at Glib::Timeout->add and (usually not a good idea
to run continually) Glib::Idle->add. those two will let the main loop run
(your program will be responsive) and call the function you provide
periodically so that you can get some processing time.
